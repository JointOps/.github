# JointOps

**A crew that operates together and gets things done.**

We're a developer collective building fast-paced, scalable technologies. We develop our own products, maintain open-source packages, and occasionally help other teams ship things that actually work.

## What We Build

🔗 **Blockchain & Web3** — Production smart contracts on Solana. Zero security incidents. Ever.

🌐 **Web Applications** — React, Next.js, Node.js, Bun. Systems that scale before you need them to.

📦 **Open Source** — Tools developers actually want to use.
